  { date: '2026-09-26', title: 'Show when each page last changed and why on /toolkit', body: 'A commit list says what changed and never why, and the reasons were only ever written by hand after the fact, so a commit that carries a Why line now writes its own note, and each page says when it last changed so a stale page is easy to spot.' },
  { date: '2026-09-26', title: 'Rewrite the résumé for AI deployment roles, and print the PDF from the page', body: 'The old résumé read as account management with AI on the side, and the roles I am going for read it the other way round, so it now leads with taking AI from discovery to adoption and proves it with evals, drops the certs that do not help that story, and prints from the page so the PDF can never fall behind the site.' },
  { date: '2026-09-26', title: 'Rewrite the site copy for readers outside AI, and split the Christie shelf by series', body: 'The site was written for people who already know what an agent or RAG is, and the people deciding whether to hire me often do not, so every row now says what the thing does in plain words, the hard terms get one plain line each, and the headline says what I actually do, which is build AI into the tools we already use and test it myself.' },
  { date: '2026-09-26', title: 'Lock every number in FACTS.md and point CLAUDE.md at it', body: 'The same number kept drifting between the homepage, the résumé and the notes whenever a copy edit rounded or reworded it, so there is now one place that says what each number is and where it came from, and if a page disagrees with it the page is wrong.' },
  { date: '2026-09-09', title: 'The change log writes itself', body: 'This list used to ask the GitHub API from your browser, which only works while the repo is public and your IP has rate limit left, and lately neither held, so now a small Action snapshots the commit log into the site on every push, which keeps the same list without an API call and means it cannot show anything that is not already deployed.' },
  { date: '2026-08-22', title: 'The mark and the card', body: 'The social card was 347×190, so every platform upscaled it into a blur, and the tab title was just my name, which meant the first thing anyone saw of this site was the least considered part of it, so I redrew both in the same type as the rest.' },
  { date: '2026-08-20', title: 'Moving the personal half', body: 'The raccoon, the tarot decks, and the tooth zones are the most interesting things here and the worst thing to put between a hiring manager and my projects, so they have their own page now, linked from the nav, and nothing was deleted.' },
  { date: '2026-08-18', title: 'Projects that show their work', body: 'The cards described what I built without showing the messy input going in and the clean result coming out, which is the part worth seeing, so every project now names its input, marks four things in the output, and ends on what it found.' },
  { date: '2026-08-14', title: 'Signal', body: 'I spent eight years doing an hour of account digging before every account call, and I got tired enough of it that I built the thing that does it in a minute.' },
  { date: '2026-06-10', title: 'Starting over', body: 'I always wanted my own website, and I wanted to teach myself to code past HTML, and doing it without a framework meant I had to understand every piece, which was slower and also the whole reason I did it.' },
