Trained logistic regression and random forest classifiers on 480K order-product rows. Veteran user AUC: 0.9886. New user AUC: 0.8566.

  description: 'I built this because every productivity app I tried assumed I already knew what I needed to do. I didn\'t. I just needed to get it out of my head first. Brain Dump is a timed free-write tool that sends your unfiltered thoughts to an AI agent, which reads the whole dump holistically and sorts everything into four buckets: things you have energy for today, things that are real but not for right now, ideas worth keeping, and things that are just weight you\'re carrying. The AI then gives you 2-3 focus tasks matched to how you actually feel, with built-in ADHD strategies and a Pomodoro timer that queues your tasks automatically. Five energy states (overwhelmed, scattered, anxious, low energy, foggy) each produce meaningfully different output. The API key is held in a Cloudflare Worker so the code is fully open source without exposing credentials.',

  title: 'Life in Pixels RAG — Asking Natural Language Questions About My Own Behavioral Data',
  description: 'I\'ve been logging 45 behavioral metrics daily since late 2025. This is a RAG system that lets me ask natural language questions about the patterns in that data — questions a spreadsheet can\'t answer. A spreadsheet can filter one thing. This can reason about the intersection of many: "On days where I was Dysregulated, what else was true?" or "What exercise has the best impact on my mood and sleep?" Each day\'s 35+ fields get converted into an information-dense text chunk, embedded locally via sentence-transformers, stored in ChromaDB, and retrieved semantically. Claude Haiku synthesizes the answer with specific date citations. The data never leaves my machine unencrypted — sensitive fields are stripped server-side by the Apps Script endpoint before the Python client ever sees them.',
