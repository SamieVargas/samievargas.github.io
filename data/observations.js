    paragraphs: [
      `The Instacart dataset gets cited constantly: 60% of items in a typical order are things the user has ordered before. I spent this week building a dbt transformation layer on top of it to make the data actually trustworthy. First real finding query and the number just fell apart.`,
      `New users (1 to 3 orders) reorder at <strong>0.221</strong>. Veterans (20+ orders) reorder at <strong>0.670</strong>. Same metric, same platform, same dataset: 3x difference. The population average isn't wrong, it's just four completely different behavioral profiles compressed into one number that describes none of them. Any ML reorder prediction model trained on the full population equally is being diluted by new-user noise the whole time. The data only becomes reliable at 10+ orders, when habit has had time to form.`,
      `Also: I'm in this dataset. I ordered groceries the day I ran this query. Yogurt, cottage cheese, produce. Dairy eggs and produce came back as my top two reorder departments at 67% and 65%. Not a surprise. <em>That was just my cart.</em>`,

  title: 'My nervous system knew about the raccoon before I did',
  paragraphs: [
    `For several nights I was sleeping badly and couldn't explain it. I blamed true crime podcasts. I cancelled plans. I woke up early one Wednesday to exercise instead — and discovered a mama raccoon and her babies had been nesting on my balcony the entire time.`,
    `The Garmin data told the story better than I could. Five consecutive days at a body battery of <strong>5 out of 100</strong> — the absolute floor — before I even knew what the threat was. Sleep score dropped from a baseline of <strong>81 to a floor of 53</strong>. HRV hit 26ms on the worst night. My nervous system was running a background alarm the whole time. It just couldn't tell me what it was tracking.`,
    `The part that surprised me most was after. The raccoons were removed on May 3. I expected to recover immediately. Body battery that day: still 5. Sleep score: 61. It took <strong>8 days</strong> to return to baseline after the threat was fully gone. The nervous system doesn't get the memo. It stays activated on its own timeline, regardless of what the situation actually is. That lag — not the disruption itself — is the thing the data made visible.`,

      `The interesting part isn't whether it holds at scale. It's what the lag says about how recovery actually works. Sleep, stress, and movement don't reset at midnight. That's the thing product teams building wellness features tend to flatten out of their models: the carryover. The day after a hard day matters as much as the hard day itself.`,

    paragraphs: [
      `I started this by querying every restaurant I actually eat at against the City's public health inspection API. Expected a few outliers in an otherwise fine picture. What I found instead: establishments that failed and got sent for follow-up visits scored an average of <strong>8 points lower</strong> than routine visits. Not higher. Lower. The corrective action loop just isn't closing.`,
      `A second pattern across 84 local brands: scores decay measurably by the <strong>5th or 6th inspection cycle</strong>. Not a dramatic failure, just slow operational erosion that routine visits don't catch until violations are compounding. The part that stuck with me: serial offenders are identifiable before things get bad. The city already has the data. The question is whether anyone's built the workflow to act on it.`,

      `My dentist is lovely. I also know her better than most people in my life at this point because I have spent so much time in that chair. The appointments are long. She is patient. I am not. The dental experience has been, to put it gently, a journey.`,
      `Got a new electric toothbrush with AI zone tracking. It maps your mouth into 16 zones and tells you which ones you actually cleaned. Three days in: it's taking me three minutes to brush properly instead of two, and it turns out I was not, in fact, getting my back molars. I thought I was. I was not.`,
      `The zone map made the problem obvious in about 45 seconds in a way that years of dentist appointments never quite did. Same information, different visibility. I'm not mad about it. I'm just very aware that good data intervention design isn't about telling people what to do. It's about showing them what they're actually doing vs. what they think they're doing. That gap is usually where the whole problem lives.`,
